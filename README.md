<h1> Notes for <i>*Deep Learning Specialization*</i> by deeplearning.ai and Andrew Ng </h1>

<br> 
<h3>Courses covered in Specialization -</h3>
<b>1) Deep Learning and Neural Network:</b><br>
<p>In course 1, you would get glimpse of Neural Network basics  including building shallow neural network, understanding math behind Forward & Backward Propagation, vectorized implementation of NN. There are also details regardinh Activation functions and basic blocks of deep NN and the hyperparameters. Basically a great start to go ahead in specialization.</p>
<p> Look for the Notes on Course 1 and Course 2 in same PDF file attached in Neural Networks folder</P>
<b>2) Improving DNN: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization:</b><br>
<p>In course 2, you would learn different regularization techniques and how they tackle overfitting. The much important Bias/Variance tradeoff and optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp and Adam</p>
<b>3) Structuring Machine Learning Projects</b><br>
<p>In course 3, you  would learn how to set up evaluation metric since the highest accuracy model might not be the best in daily practice. Also learn how to select and split the train/test/validation set and the methods we could use while lacking of data</p>
<b>4) Convolutional Neural Network</b><br>
<p>In course 4, you will learn how does a Convolutional Neural Network work by understanding the theory and maths of convolutional filter, Maxpooling filter, etc. On top of it, famous pre-trained network: LeNet5, AlexNetâ€™ VGG-16, and ResNet, and how to utilize them with transfer learning</p>
<p> Look for the Notes on Course 4 in CNN section </P>
<b>5) Sequence Models</b>
<p>In course 5, you learn about RNNs, GRU's and LSTM then dive in to NLP and teach the major concepts such as Word Embedding, Word2Vec, Bleu Score, Beam Search, Skip Gram, etc.</p>
<p>Notes will be added soon for Sequence models </p>
